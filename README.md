This project uses deep learning to classify urban audio (traffic, construction, speech, etc.) into predefined categories. It's designed for real-time use in smart cities, noise monitoring, and safety systems.

🚀 Features
Audio classification using CNN/RNN

Feature extraction with librosa and scipy

Real-time prediction via web interface

Scalable Python backend

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

🔧 Workflow
Collect & label diverse urban sounds

Extract features (MFCCs, spectrograms)

Train model with deep learning (CNN/RNN)

Deploy via web UI + backend

Evaluate & improve performance

⚙️ Tools
Python, TensorFlow/Keras

Librosa, Scipy, Sklearn
