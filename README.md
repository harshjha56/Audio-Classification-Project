This project focuses on classifying urban sounds like traffic, construction, and human activity using deep learning. Audio features such as MFCCs and spectrograms are extracted using librosa and scipy. A CNN/RNN model is trained to recognize different sound types.

The system is deployed with a simple web interface that allows users to upload audio files and get real-time predictions. 
The backend is built with Python and is scalable for practical applications. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
